# Esri Leaflet WebPack Example

Example of using [Esri Leaflet](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet) with [WebPack](http://webpack.github.io/)!

1. Install JSPM `npm install -g webpack`
2. Install a local web server `npm install -g http-server`
2. [Fork and clone this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
3. `cd` into `esri-leaflet-webpack-example`
4. Install dependencies with `npm install`
5. Build the project with `webpack`
6. Start the web server `http-server .`
7. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Smaller Builds Using the Esri Leaflet Bundler

This sample includes 2 modules from [Esri Leaflet](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet):

* `featureLayer`
* `basemapLayer`

and 3 modules from [Esri Leaflet Geocoder](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-geocoder):

* `geosearch`
* `arcgisOnlineProvider`
* `featureLayerProvider`

You can create a custom build that includes all of these modules with the [Esri Leaflet Bundler](http://github.com/esri/esri-leaflet-bundler). This will reduce the size of your build to from 61.81 kB (gzipped) to 55.17 kB (gzipped), an 11% reduction.

Then create a file called `esri-leaflet-custom-build.js` with the following contents:

```js
import {
  featureLayer,
  basemapLayer
} from 'esri-leaflet';

import {
  geosearch,
  arcgisOnlineProvider,
  featureLayerProvider
} from 'esri-leaflet-geocoder';

export default {
  featureLayer: featureLayer,
  basemapLayer: basemapLayer,
  geosearch: geosearch,
  arcgisOnlineProvider: arcgisOnlineProvider,
  featureLayerProvider: featureLayerProvider
};
```

Note that since will will compile this to ES 6 modules we can export not just the `default` export but exports for each individual module.

Then run `esri-leaflet-bundler esri-leaflet-custom-build.js -o esri-leaflet-custom.js --sourcemap inline --format cjs` to generate your custom build.

Then replace the references to `esri-leaflet` and `esri-leaflet` geocoder in your in `main.js` with references to your custom build:

```js
var esri = require('./esri-leaflet-custom');
var geocoding = require('./esri-leaflet-custom');
```
